> Here are part of my monthly daily reading lists, I only exported the five star ones(which I think it's good enough to post them here)

> By the way, I record all the things I read by [Alfred Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/quiver-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12)/[读读日报](http://dudu.zhihu.com/circle/173514), and I will do the archive post monthly
